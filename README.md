# clox

This is my C implementation of Lox - a small programming language for scripting -
from the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://www.craftinginterpreters.com/).

Code-wise, it follows the [reference implementation](
https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters) of clox exactly. However, I
decided to use Meson as the build system, rather than a Makefile, out of pure
curiosity.
